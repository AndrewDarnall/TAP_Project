# There are two ways to use Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper in your pipeline

<ol>
    <li>Use the official confluent docker container</li>
    <li>Use this custom container but by downloading the software from the official website</li>
</ol>

The link to the website as the time of building this project is: https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/3.4.1/kafka_2.13-3.4.1.tgz
