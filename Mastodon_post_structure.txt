As you all know, modern APIs share data in a structured way, often times using a markup language
such as XML or JSON, mastodon posts (or 'tweets') are no exceptions to the rule.

Every event that I am streaming from the stream API is an ordered pair,
(CRUD action, data: payload) and the payload part of the insert and update
actions is in the JSON structured format

I am certain that if need be any of the fields of the data can turnout to be useful
for some kind of analysis, however in the case of my project, the only relevant
fields are:

1) id
2) created_at
3) in_reply_to_account
4) sensitive
5) visibility
6) uri
7) url
8) favourites_count
9) edited_at
10) avatar_static
11) header
12) followers_count
13) following_count
14) statuses_count
15) last_status_at
16) pronouns
17) verified_at
18) media_attatchments
19) mentions
20) tags (saved in the end of the post)

With this information, and a proper organization within Kafka Topics, can grant countless interesting investigations
regarding social behavior, social influece and in general what is trending

I conclude by stating that knowing how to use data is not allways so obvious, especially in today's day and age
where anyone, with the right skills, can build anything
