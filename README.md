# TAP_Project

This repository has the source code for the Technologies for Advanced Programming course, in which I learned about various technologies and 
how to choose them based on my Data Engineering needs.

In this course I studied the wonderful world of Big Data and Data Engineering.

I have previous experience with Big Data and Data Engineering thanks to the Samsung Innoavtion Campus course in which these technologies
came particularly useful to retrieve, send, store, process and enrich data collected by IoT devices.

The topics of the TAP course were:

- Data Ingestion: Apache Nifi, Apache Logstash, Apache Flume and Fluentd
- Data Streaming: Apache Kafka + Zookeeper
- Data Processing: Apache Spark + MLlib
- Data Indexing & Query: Elastichsearch
- Data Visualization: Kibana
- Docker and containerization, which I already dealt with in the Distributed Systems and Web Technologies course done previously

### Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained during the course where I implement a full pipeline by collecting data from a source, Mastodon in this case, and study and extract value from real time information.

I chose mastodn because out of all the (freely available) data sources it offered some promising data from which to extract interesting insights from.

I already have previous experience with social media APIs and data science & data anaytics from the Social Media Data Analytics course
therefore this project has been very fun and insightful to work on.
